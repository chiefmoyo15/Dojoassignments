          <h3 class="move">What is Git?</h3>
          <p>It is a version conrol system; you can thik of it as a series of snapshorts (commits) of your code base.With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make brances to experiment and come back to a previous snapshots you took or meerge those experiments into the app</p>
          <h3>What is GitHub</h3>
          <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboratino. It lets you and others work together on porjets from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during devlopment</p>
